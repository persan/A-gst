# A-gst
Ada binding to the GStreamer library.

# Current state of the library.
The library consits at the moment only of compilable Ada-spec generated from the gstreamer header-files in the package herachy "GST_Low_Level".

Remaning work to be done is to write Ada-style glib-bindings using the herachy "GStreamer", as its done for other glib classes in GTK-Ada.
